<h1>FAQ</h1>
<p><b>Why won't Arcane give the autorole or rewards I setup?</b>
</p><p>Arcane can't give the role if the Arcane role is under the specified role.
To fix the problem we recommend you place Arcane's role above the top or above the roles needed to give.</p>
<br>
<b>Is Arcane's code public?</b>
<p>Arcane's code is not public and we don't have any plans of making it public.</p>
<br>
<b>Do you provide code support?</b>
<p>We do not support with code anymore. This hasn't always been the case, it's just come to the point where supporting took more time
then developing took.</p>
<br>
<b>When will my feature I've requested be added?</b>
<p>First off, features requested will only be considered through the #suggestions channel on our Discord server. If you do submit a
request, it will enter into a review state. Our team will decide how much resources are needed and how much time it will take to
develop before giving you a response. Keep in mind, not all requests are accepted.</p>
