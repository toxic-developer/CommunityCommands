<b>Is Arcane's code public?</b>
<p>Arcane's code is not public and we don't have any plans of making it public.</p>
<br>
<b>Do you provide code support?</b>
<p>We do not support with code anymore. This hasn't always been the case, it's just come to the point where supporting took more time
then developing took.</p>
<br>
<b>When will my feature I've requested be added?</b>
<p>First off, features requested will only be considered through the #suggestions channel on our Discord server. If you do submit a
request, it will enter into a review state. Our team will decide how much resources are needed and how much time it will take to
develop before giving you a response. Keep in mind, not all requests are accepted.</p>
